# E-commerce website üõçÔ∏è

This project is a modern e-commerce website using React to demonstrate my budding frontend development skills. The project uses CSS Modules for styling and React for dynamic data loading, which allowed me to develop my technical skills. The design was implemented from a template in Figma, which strengthened my skills in translating designs into a functional website. I used the Figma page design and data.json from Frontendmentor.io.

## Features

 - Dynamic Quantity Management: Allows users to increase or decrease the quantity of an item in the cart using buttons or by directly inputting the quantity.
 - Real-time Form Validation: Validates email format and checks if the cart is empty before allowing form submission.
 - Dynamic Input Handling: Uses useState to manage form data and dynamically updates the state as the user inputs data.
 - Order Summary Calculation: Calculates total price, shipping cost, VAT, and grand total based on the items in the cart.
 - Confirmation Modal: Displays a confirmation modal upon successful form submission, showing order details.
 - Cart Management: Clears the cart and navigates to the home page after order confirmation.
 - Dynamic Data Handling: Loads product data, including images, names, prices, and other details, from a JSON file, making it easy to update and manage product information.
 - Responsive Design: Styled using CSS modules to ensure a responsive and clean user interface.
 - PropTypes Validation: Uses PropTypes to validate the props passed to the component, ensuring type safety.
